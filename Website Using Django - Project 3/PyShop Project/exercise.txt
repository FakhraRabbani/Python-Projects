1. Modify django website such that when we navigate to products/new, we will see page with new products

# Solution
In products app, open up views module
In this module, we define a new function.
Then we need to map this new function to url, so open up url module in product app and add another url pattern
http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/new -> in browser we can see new product msg




2. U want to have a concept of offering discount. I want to create a new module for offer.
In this class, we should have 3 attributes -> code (VCA2142), description (textual field -> 20 % off all products), discount(floating point no -> 0.2)
Create this module, then create migration and update database.

# Solution
In modules model, right after Product class, i am gonna define a new Class Offer and add attribues.
After creating Offer Class, we need to do migration.
So open terminal and run -> python manage.py makemigrations
After this run -> python manage.py migrate
Then drag and drop your db.sqlite3 again in database, u can see in products app, u will have productsoffer
