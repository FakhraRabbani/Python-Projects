Imagine i ask u to write a program to scan an image, and tell if its a cat or a dog.
If u want to build this prgrm using traditional programming techniques, ur program is going to get overly complex.
You will have to come up with lots of rules to come up with specific curves, edges and colors in an image to tell if its a cat or dog.
But if i give you a black and white photo, ur rules may not work, they may break. Then u would have to rewrite the.
Or i may give u a pic of cat or a dog from different angle that we did not predict before.
So solving this prblm using traditional programming techniques is going to get overly complex or sometimes impossible.
What if i ask u to extend this prgrm such that it supports 3 kinds of animals, Cats, dogs and horses.
Once agin u will have to rewrite all those rules.
Thats not going to work.

So machine learning is a technique to solve these kinds of prblms
We build a model or an engine and give it lots and lots of data.
For eg, we give it thousands or tens of thousands of pictures of cats and dogs.
Our model will then find and learn patterns and the input data, so we can give it a new pic of a cat that we havet seen before.
And ask it, is it a cat or dog or a horse and it will tell us with a certain level of accuracy.
The more input data we give it, the more accurate our model is going to be.

Machine learning has other applications in self driving cars, robotics, language processing, vision processing, forecasting things like stock market trends and the weather, games and so on.
